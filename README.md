# File-Similarity-Checker

This is a program that analyzes a set of files and reports their similarity using the method described
below. This program will use two or more threads to read directory entries and analyze the word
frequencies of text files, then compute the Jensen-Shannon distance between the word frequencies of
pairs of files.
